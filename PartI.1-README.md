PART I.1: Bike Brake Light

This code serves as an automatic brake light for a bicycle, made to work with the M5Stack Atom Matrix.

It has 5 modes:
  1. OFF
  2. Manual Rear strobe (RED): where the LEDs strobe red at a predetermined interval
  3. Manual Front strobe (WHITE): where the LEDs strobe white at a predetermined interval
  4. Automatic Rear Mode Rear (RED): LEDs are solid during a braking event. Return to strobe when riding.
  5. Automatic Front Mode Rear (White): LEDs are solid during a braking event. Return to strobe when riding.

These modes can be toggled by clicking on the M5Stack Atom's screen button.

The code required to run the program is called "Part_i_1.ino", located in the "Part_I_1" folder
This code requires the "M5Atom.h" and "FastLED.h" libraries to be installed on Arduino.
